# Business-Analyzer
I had a big setback with my project at first, because I did not read the instructions well enough
and did not understand that I had to create the interfaces and list constructors myself. After I realized this,
I went to office hours and spent some time reviewing the class slides, and it went pretty smooth from there.
I have a slight bug where my zip summary output is one less on my linked list than my array list, and was not
able to figure out what was causing this. Other than this, my code runs smoothly.
